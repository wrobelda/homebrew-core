# Homebrew Core

Core formulae for the Homebrew package manager.

Core formulae for the Linuxbrew package manager (Homebrew on Linux or Windows 10 Subsystem for Linux) are in [Linuxbrew/homebrew-core](https://github.com/Linuxbrew/homebrew-core).

## How do I install these formulae?

Just `brew install <formula>`. This is the default tap for Homebrew and is installed by default.
